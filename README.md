# RREX2008

RREX2008 is a realistic simulation of the circulation in a northeastern part of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, using the oceanic modeling system CROCO. The study domain covers an area ranging from 53.8 N to 62.5°N and from 20.5°W to 37.8°W. In this simulation, we injected a tracer in the ocean upper-layer to analyse how it gets transported at depth by small ocean movements known as submesoscale fronts (0.1 - 10 km). The repertory gather all the codes used to analyse the simulation outputs.
